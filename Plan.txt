Backlog
    
    Integrate file reader to program
    Display: withdraw, deposit, and total
    Remove Account/statement button -> LATER: this will not be too hard, just need to delete all children and current node
    Transactions will just be a dictionary, not a class
        statement will have a list of transactions
        When selected: items will be displayed as "Key: value" in text box
        Hide items for list and add 

    Transaction data page. Display all information about a transaction. Hide add button and list
    Reduce item list run time. Currently loops through all child elements on add()
    Support manual entry of statements and transactions

Investigate and decide 
    Do I need Parent and manager in the UI class?
    Potentially an obsterver design pattern?
    Main.py calls class for PyQt?
